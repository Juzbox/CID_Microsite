                <p>The <a href="https://www.laanvannoi.nl/"" target="blank">Laan Van NOI</a> area, one of three key gateways into The Hague's <a href="https://www.ciddenhaag.nl/"" target="blank">Central Innovation District (CID)</a>, is soon to be renovated. The CID is the economic heart of The Hague and the region and holds enormous potential. The area already provides employment for nearly 80,000 people and has 30,000 students. 45,000 people live in the area in 23,000 homes.</p>
                <p>
                    This plan aims to raze the current structure to overhaul its current mix-use building and parking infrastructure into a dense but car-free area on both sides of the current train station. According to the current <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Z_qUvwoA0ZfwZ6s4h7MZDvo5dWIDNJ9/view?usp=sharing" target="blank">Structuurvisie document</a>, "It will be an area where the boundaries between recreation, living and working are blurred. Where compaction and greening go together."</p>
                <p>However, the sense isolation and its impact on mental health that the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated has made the city realize that its vision did not sufficiently address these issues. The municipality of The Hague therefore asked the <a href="https://www.kennismakendenhaag.nl/over-city-deal-kennis-maken" target="blank">Kennis Maken Den Haag</a> to advise them on redevelopment of the Central Innovation District to better integrate strategies to stem loneliness, provide opportunities for social cohesion and take into account the importance of green areas.</p>

                <p><span>Collaborative Troubleshooting</span></p>
                <p>The five day workshop challenged students from <a href=https://www.thehagueuniversity.com/ target="blank">Haagse Hogeschool</a>, <a href=https://www.eur.nl/en target="blank">Erasmus</a> and <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en" target="blank">Leiden University</a>, to unpack the Structuurvisie for the Laan Van NOI area and try to imagine who may be overlooked by the current vision. This approach heavily drew from the works of <a href="https://www.artforum.com/books/mara-mills-talks-to-sara-hendren-about-design-and-disability-84333" target="blank">Sara Hendren</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemarie_Garland-Thomson" target="blank">Rosemarie Garland-Thomson</a> on the concept of states of misfit and action settings. The students went through several exercises of research, observation, and digital prototyping to arrive at a final set of narratives.</p>

                <p>The whole experience was kicked off with a visit to the Laan Van NOI followed by several facilitated exercises held remotely using this <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lZ_ehLY=/" target="blank">Miro board.</a></p>


                <p>The students were tasked with looking most specifically at the topics of loneliness</p>

                <p>When designing for someone like David, we want to improve his living environment and ensure that he will easily meet new people and stay healthy.

There’s free entry and people connect with each other through music, food or other experiences. The other example we drew from is <a href="https://wij.boerenenburen.nl" target="_blank">Boeren en buren</a> which enables residents to meet their neighbors and buy vegetables and fruit from farmers at a weekly pick up point in a neighborhood.</p>

                <p>When designing for someone like Mitch, we want him to have access to nature and ensure that he can go from school to home safely even if he lives outside the Laan Van NOI area. We'd ensure this by having him walk through a car-fee neighborhood for most of the way to school. <a href="https://faircompanies.com/articles/carfree-cities-removing-pollution-from-the-front-yard/" target="_blank">Florisdorf</a> in Vienna offers a good example of what a car-free neighborhood might look like. In addition to safety, it also is environmentally friendly. We  want kids his age to have convenient access to nature so we designed a community garden. This is what the NGO <a href="https://dug.org/" target="_blank">Denver Urban Gardens (DUG)</a> does in Colorado, USA. Research has shown that their garden initiatives foster both public health and community feeling.

                    <li>The CID's car-free environment must extent to the nearby canal and offer safe tansitions into the car-friendly areas</li>
                    <li>Place more focus on useful and meaningful green spaces</li>
                    <li>Ensure the walkability to schools in the Laan Van NOI residential areas and other central cmmunity hubs
                    </li>
                    <li>Offer easy nature accessibility that also entices curiosity and exploration</li>
